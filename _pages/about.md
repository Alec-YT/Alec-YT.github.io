# About

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell University. I obtained my PhD at École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées in France.

# Research

My research focuses on the development of advanced computational methods for the simulation of underground constructions, with particular emphasis on tunneling applications. I am especially interested in scientific machine learning approaches, including both inverse modeling for parameter identification and surrogate modeling for efficient prediction. 

In parallel, I work on computational optimal experimental design methods, which aim to determine the most informative measurement strategies — for example, optimally positioning field sensors to maximize data value and improve model calibration.

# Teaching
At Cornell University, I am supervising a group of undergraduate students for the design of utilidors - shallow tunnels in New-York City intended to house utilities.

The project involves traditional numerical modeling using finite element methods the implementation of machine learning surrogate models. For this purpose, I have developed dedicated tutorials based on the MOOSE and FEniCSx frameworks.
