# About

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell University. I obtained my PhD at École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées in France.

# Research
My research aims to develop computational methods for simulating underground constructions, particularly tunnels. I particularly focus on scientific machine learning for inverse and surrogate modeling, and on computational optimal experimental design to identify the most informative sensor placement strategies and improve model calibration.

# Teaching
At Cornell University, I supervise a team of undergraduate students working on the design of utilidors — shallow tunnels in New York City intended to house utilities. The project involves traditional numerical modeling using finite difference methods and the implementation of machine learning surrogate models.
